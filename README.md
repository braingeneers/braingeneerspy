## Modules and Subpackages

`braingeneerspy` includes several subpackages and modules, each serving a specific purpose within the Braingeneers project:

- `braingeneers.analysis`: Contains code for data analysis.
- `braingeneers.data`: Provides code for basic data access, including subpackages for handling electrophysiology, fluidics, and imaging data.
- `braingeneers.iot`: Offers code for Internet of Things (IoT) communication, including a messaging interface.
- `braingeneers.ml`: Contains code related to machine learning, such as a high-performance PyTorch data loader for electrophysiology data.
- `braingeneers.utils`: Provides utility functions, including S3 access and smart file opening.

## S3 Access and Configuration

### `braingeneers.utils.s3wrangler`

This module extends the `awswrangler.s3 package` for Braingeneers/PRP access. For API documentation and usage examples, please visit the [official documentation](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Here's a basic usage example:

```python
import braingeneers.utils.s3wrangler as wr

# Get all UUIDs from s3://braingeneers/ephys/
uuids = wr.list_directories('s3://braingeneers/ephys/')
print(uuids)
```

### `braingeneers.utils.smart_open_braingeneers`

This module configures `smart_open` for Braingeneers use on PRP/S3. When importing this version of `smart_open`, Braingeneers defaults will be autoconfigured. Note that `smart_open` supports both local and S3 files, so it can be used for all files, not just S3 file access.

Here's a basic usage example:

```python
import braingeneers.utils.smart_open_braingeneers as smart_open

with smart_open.open('s3://braingeneersdev/test_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.read())
```

You can also safely replace Python's default `open` function with `smart_open.open`:

```python
import braingeneers.utils.smart_open_braingeneers as smart_open

open = smart_open.open
```

## Customizing S3 Endpoints

By default, `smart_open` and `s3wrangler` are pre-configured for the standard Braingeneers S3 endpoint. However, you can specify a custom `ENDPOINT` if you'd like to use a different S3 service. This can be a local path or an endpoint URL for another S3 service (note that `s3wrangler` only supports S3 services, not local paths, while `smart_open` supports local paths).

To set a custom endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Set an environment variable `ENDPOINT` with the new endpoint. For example, on Unix-based systems:

   ```bash
   export ENDPOINT="https://s3-west.nrp-nautilus.io"
   ```

2. Call `braingeneers.set_default_endpoint(endpoint: str)` and `braingeneers.get_default_endpoint()`. These functions will update both `smart_open` and `s3wrangler` (if it's an S3 endpoint, local path endpoints are ignored by `s3wrangler`).

### Using the PRP Internal S3 Endpoint

When running a job on the PRP, you can use the PRP internal S3 endpoint, which is faster than the default external endpoint. To do this, add the following environment variable to your job YAML file:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ...
        command: ...
        args: ...
        env:
          - name: "ENDPOINT"
            value: "http://rook-ceph-rgw-nautiluss3.rook"
```

Please note that this will only work on jobs run in the PRP environment. Setting the `ENDPOINT` environment variable can also be used to specify an endpoint other than the PRP/S3.

## Documentation

The docs directory has been set up using `sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/` to create a base project Documentation structure. You can add inline documentation (NumPy style) to further enrich our project's documentation. To render the documentation locally, navigate to the `docs/build/html` folder in the terminal and run `python3 -m http.server`.

## Working in Codespaces

### Project Structure

- **src/:** This folder contains scripts and notebooks representing completed work by the team.

- **pyproject.toml:** This file follows the guidelines from [PyPA](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) for documenting project setup information.

### Customizing the Devcontainer

The `devcontainer.json` file allows you to customize your Codespace container and VS Code environment using extensions. You can add more extensions to tailor the environment to your specific needs. Explore the VS Code extensions marketplace for additional tools that may enhance your workflow.
